# EDeMOS (Electricity Demand Mapping from Open-Source data)

</pre>

## Workflow steps

### 1. Create a new environment in Conda

The file [edemos_env.yml](edemos_env.yml) will allow you to create a new environment in Conda. Running EDeMOS from this environment should avoid any issues with libraries like gdal, h3, h3pandas, and others.  To create the environment, run:
```
conda env create -f edemos_env.yml
```
You only need to do this the very first time. Thereafter you just need to run:
```
conda activate edemos_env
```
before running EDeMOS.

### 2. Choose country
Set the variable ACTIVE_COUNTRY in [config.py](config.py).

### 3. Download data sets 
As required for the specific country (see below). Files need to be named and put in folders to match the paths given in the [config.py](config.py) and config_{Country}.py

### 4. Run data conversion scripts
- [rasterize_rwi.py](Buildings/rasterize_rwi.py) (This may take several minutes or more to run)
- [read_DHS_hh_to_df.py](Buildings/HouseholdEnergyUse/read_DHS_hh_to_df.py)
- [read_DHS_services_to_df.py](Buildings/HouseholdEnergyUse/read_DHS_services_to_df.py) 
(select appropriate labels in config file)

### 5. Adjust census data
In the census data file, the following colummns should be available: HH urban, rural, total, size of HH (urban and rural) and share women

### 6. Set resolution
This is set in config_{Country}.py. HEX_SIZE=5 for testing, 6 for meaningful results, 7 for best results

### 7. Run [GeoDem.ipynb](GeoDem.ipynb)
To run .ipynb file, you can use jupyter lab, to install it, run:
```
pip install jupyterlab
``` 
In your anaconda prompt, navigate to your working folder. Activate the environment by running:
```
conda activate edemos_env
```
Then run 
```
jupyter lab
```
You can then access the different scripts and run [GeoDem.ipynb](GeoDem.ipynb)

## Data sets

1. Zambia Census 2022. [Zamstats, 2022](https://www.zamstats.gov.zm/census/).
2. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). [DHS](https://dhsprogram.com/data/dataset/Kenya_Standard-DHS_2022.cfm)
3. A high-resolution gridded dataset to assess electrification in sub-Saharan Africa [^1].
4. Gridded global Gross Domestic Product and Human Development Index datasets over 1990–2015 [^2]. 
5. High-Resolution Electricity Access. set_lightscore_sy_xxxx.tif: Predicted likelihood that a settlement is electrified (0 to 1) [^3].
6. Relative Wealth Index (RWI) [^4].
7. Building footprints [^5].
8. Energy balance (UN stats)
